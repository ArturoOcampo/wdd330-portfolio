            <h2>Readings</h2>
            <h4>Programming basics</h4>
            <p>This chapter was very interesting, first a little history about the programming world, and the low-level programming languages and High-level programming languages.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Basically, the difference is the way that you use to communicate with a computer, the machine code or assembly language, is very primitive and complex if you want to say "hello world" in this way is a big line of zeros and ones. So, high-level languages simplify the way that you can communicate with the computer.

            <h4>Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h4>
            <p>The array method is very interesting because you can save information in this matrix, In JavaScript, you can initialize an array in this way:</p>

            <p>In this section, we’ll begin to look at logical conditions that allow you to control the flow of a program by running different blocks of code, depending on the results of certain operations.</p>
            <p>If statement, is a condition that you can apply is X condition is true or false.</p>
            <p>We can create an array literal using square brackets that already contain some initial values, so there’s no need to add each value one by one. Here's an example:</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="images/img-w2-2.PNG" alt="...">
            <p>The else keyword can be used to add an alternative block of code to run if the condition is false. An if ... else statement looks like this:</p>

            <p>Loops will repeat a piece of code over and over again according to certain conditions.</p>

            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <p>Basically, a function in JavaScript is a way that you can organize and structure a program. is like the name means "function" like turn on the light or turn off. each function has steps that generate a result. in JavaScript, you can call this function in some cases and get a result.</p>
            <p>This is an example of a function:</p>
